SendBird SyncManager Android Sample
===========
SendBird SyncManager Android Sample is based on [basic](https://github.com/sendbird/SendBird-Android/tree/master/basic) sample and SyncManager is integrated to support local caching.

## SyncManager
[SyncManager SDK](https://github.com/sendbird/sendbird-syncmanager-android) is a support add-on for [SendBird SDK](https://github.com/sendbird/SendBird-SDK-Android). Major benefits of `SyncManager` are,  
  
 * Local cache integrated: store channel/message data in local storage for fast view loading.  
 * Event-driven data handling: subscribe channel/message event like `insert`, `update`, `remove` at a single spot in order to apply data event to view.  
  
Check out [Android Sample with SyncManager](https://github.com/sendbird/SendBird-Android/tree/master/syncmanager) which is same as [Android Sample](https://github.com/sendbird/SendBird-Android) with `SyncManager` integrated.    
For more information about `SyncManager`, please refer to [SyncManager README](https://github.com/sendbird/sendbird-syncmanager-android/blob/master/README.md).
